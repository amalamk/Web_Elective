     The Department shall form an Internal Evaluation Committee (IEC) for the seminar
    with academic coordinator for that program as the Chairperson/Chairman and seminar
    coordinator & seminar guide as members. During the seminar presentation of a
    student, all members of IEC shall be present. <br>
     Formation of IEC and guide allotment shall be completed within a week after the
    University examination (or last working day) of the previous semester. <br>
     Guide shall provide required input to their students regarding the selection of topic/
    paper. <br>
     Choosing a seminar topic: The topic for a UG seminar should be current and broad
    based rather than a very specific research work. It's advisable to choose a topic for the
    Seminar to be closely linked to the final year project area. Every member of the project
    team could choose or be assigned Seminar topics that covers various aspects linked to
    the Project area. <br>
     A topic/paper relevant to the discipline shall be selected by the student during the
    semester break. <br>
     Topic/Paper shall be finalized in the first week of the semester and shall be submitted
    to the IEC. <br>
     The IEC shall approve the selected topic/paper by the second week of the semester. <br>
     Accurate references from genuine peer reviewed published material to be given in the
    report and to be verified. <br>

    <a name="PROJECT"><h2 ><b>PROJECT PHASE 1</b></h2></a>
    <p><b>Phase 1 Target</b><br>
         Literature study/survey of published literature on the assigned topic <br>
         Formulation of objectives <br>
         Formulation of hypothesis/ design/ methodology <br>
         Formulation of work plan and task allocation. <br>
         Block level design documentation <br>
         Seeking project funds from various agencies <br>
         Preliminary Analysis/Modeling/Simulation/Experiment/Design/Feasibility study <br>
